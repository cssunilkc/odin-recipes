    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These butter chicken breasts are dipped in beaten eggs and cracker crumbs,<br>
        then baked with butter. These chicken breasts are really tender and moist with<br>
        excellent flavor! I never have leftovers.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup crushed buttery round cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Place cracker crumbs and eggs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker<br>
            crumbs with garlic salt and pepper.
        </li>

        <li>
            Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated<br>
            chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the<br>
            juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into<br>
            the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>

        <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
